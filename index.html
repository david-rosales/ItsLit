              What is it? LUX (Light Under eXamination - we tried) was a hackathon project
              aimed at exploring the applications of computer vision.

              <h5 id="features1">Overview</h5>
              <p>
                Virtual reality systems are gradually becoming more accessible.
                 With the Oculus Rift, you can now visually immerse yourself in
                  these virtual worlds and with the Leap Motion, you can even
                  interact with these environments through gestures.
                  Unfortunately, feedback systems are still miles behind.
              </p>

              <p>
                We designed and built the Force Feel'd to fill in this gap
                created by the disparity between senses. The glove interfaces
                with both the Oculus Rift and the Leap Motion to bring simple,
                unidirectional feedback to these VR interfaces, bridging mind
                and hand.
              </p>

              <h5 id="features2">Key Features</h5>
              Force Feel'd was developed with the pitfalls of typical haptics
              systems in mind, to build a better and more robust platform.
              <ul>
                <li>Controls resistivity of motion, not direct manipulation of
                  your hand.</li>
                <li>Interfaces with preexisting Unity projects to make it easy
                  to integrate into projects.</li>
                <li>Makes use of simple Serial and Bluetooth APIs so that it can
                  be controlled and manipulated regardless of language or
                  project environments.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5 id="features3">Initial Prototype and Development</h5>
              <p>
                We created the initial prototype at <strong>Phase I</strong> of
                <a href="http://makemit.org">MakeMIT</a>, a hardware hackathon
                sponsored by MIT. When going about the design of the glove, we
                aimed for creating an experience that would provide a great deal
                of authenticity when interacting with objects in the virtual space
                while still being safe to use.
              </p>
              <p>
                With these design principals in mind, we came up with one of the
                key features of the product: the glove does not control motion,
                but instead <strong>resist</strong> motion. The worse that our
                actuated components can do is prevent the user's finger from being able
                to push down more than it already has.
              </p>
              <p class="center-text">
                <img class="feature-image" src="static/v1-cad-mockup.jpg"/>
                CAD mockup for our laser cut parts for the initial prototypes.
              </p>
              <p>
                We did this by creating finger modules that are comprised of 3
                parts: the arm, the spool, and the break. The arm provides an
                just enough elastic force to keep the spool tight, but not enough
                to prevent the user from being able to actually use thier hand
                under normal conditions. The spool holds most of the line that
                is then connected to the finger. It also provides the contact
                surface for the break to work properly. The breaks simply surround
                spool and apply a range of friction forces to the spool to give
                the allusion of touching objects with different viscosities.
              </p>

                Picture of our assembled prototype from MakeMIT Phase I.
              </p>
              <p>
                In terms of electrical components, we used an simple
                Arduino communicating with a computer via serial, using signals
                from the computer to manipulate two servo motors.  For safety we
                required a constant "Watchdog" signal, which if not received
                would release all brakes in the glove. This way if there was a
                software error or crash the user would not be stuck. Both power
                and communication was sent through the USB tether.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the software demo side, we made heavy use of Unity and example
                projects that resided within the Leap Motion and Oculus SDK's.
                Because Unity scripts can be written in C#, we simply used the
                default serial library in C# to communicate with the glove
                through a USB host. This script has public interfaces to send
                different signals to the glove from within a scene. Since we
                wanted to add varying levels of resistance collisions of
                different types, we created additional scripts that would
                interface with our glove to dictate the degree of resistance
                that was desired. However this meant that any collidable object
                that we wanted to be able to feel with the glove would need to
                use implement this script and add its resistance factor, this
                script would then be in charge of calling a method on our main
                script that would. In regards to the Watch Dog signal that was
                described earlier, our main script that was in charge of handling
                the constant checking in to ensure that the device and evniroment
                is all properly configured.

              </p>
              <h5 id="features4">Second Generation Improvements</h5>
              <p>
                While working on improvements for the second version of our product,
                we had two goals in mind: make the platform easier incorporate
                into other projects and make the glove wireless.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since we made heavy use of Unity previously, we continued to
                expand on what we had and greatly improved the assets that we
                used to interface with the glove. This time around, we
                reimplemented our scripts such that it would use the physics of
                the objects that are being interacted with to dictate how much
                resistance was to be provided. This didn't require additional
                scripts that would need to be added to each object that would be
                collided with, instead the hand asset would be able to detect
                collisions and from there send the message to glove with how
                much resistivity was needed for the collision.
              </p>
              <p class="center-text">
                <img class="feature-image" src="static/v2-image-on.jpg"/>
                Picture of the second prototype and Leap Motion Sensor.
              </p>
              <p>
                To accomplish the second goal, we added a Bluetooth sensor and
                battery pack along with using a smaller microcontroller to have
                this package fit more easily on the forearm. This all required
                us to move away from the straight serial implementation that we
                had before to instead using Bluetooth to communicate to the
                glove. This required that we start up a Bluetooth server and
                have our demos connect to the glove to start transmission.
                Furthermore, our new watchdog signal would be whether the glove
                is connected to our demo or not.
              </p>
              <p>
                In terms of the other hardware, the focus was to make the footprint
                of the different compoenents smaller, thus making the whole glove
                easier to wear. As such we created smaller, vertical brakes as
                well using fabric for the base of the glove. We also shrunk the footprint
                of the electical components by using a smaller arduino and a small
                bluetooh receiver.

                On the software sides of the project with David.
                I was specifically in charge of system setup and integration of the different
                systems we used. This really just amounted to wrestling with everything to make
                sure all of the required configurations were set and everything could be built.
                Lots of pair programming with David.

                Electrical engineer with experience in embedded design and IC design.
                A Senior at MIT majoring in electrical engineering.
                <br /><br />
                For LUX, he did the electronics design and assembly, along with the needed
                microcontroller programing to interface with the servos and the computer.
                He also worked on both the microcontroller and computer side debugging the interface
                to ensure reliability. Finally he set up some capacitive touch buttons for
                controlling the light's brightness.

                For the first prototype, was tasked with all of the CAD work and
                processing for 3D printing and laser cutting. Also worked on bits
                and pieces of the general design of the hardware. For the second
                prototype, did all of the ergonomic work and design, as well as
                the design for the finger mounts and arm plates.

                  For the first generation Force Feel'd, he designed both
                  generations of our braking mechanism, finger supports and
                  forearm mount, and ancillary mechanicals for both models.
                  Additionally, manufacture and assembly of "hard" components
