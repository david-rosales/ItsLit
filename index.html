              What is it? LUX (Light Under eXamination - we tried) was a hackathon project
              aimed at exploring the applications of computer vision.

              </ul>

              <h5 id="features1">Overview</h5>
              <p>
                Computer vision systems are becoming more accesible and prolific
                in everyday computing. It is being used and integrated with
                autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, augmented reality, and
                gesture control.
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the principle goals of this project was to find more novel
                use cases for computer vision systems. As more hands on engineers,
                we wanted to develop a system that
                could be applied in a shop / workbench setting. A problem that
                we quickly noticed while trying to brainstorm was that we kept
                having to move lights around while we making simple models and
                diagrams. With that the idea was born: a autonomous light tracking
                system.
              </p>

              <h5 id="features2">Key Design Goals and Features</h5>
              <p>
              LUX was developed with a few key tenants in mind to build out
              a robust platform:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Make the platform easy to expand and capable of adding more lights and cameras.</li>
                <li>Trackers should be passive to avoid added complexity.</li>
                <li>Multi-trackers and multi-camera setups should be supported to allow for collaboration.</li>
                <li>Make shifting of tracking objects as effortless of possible.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5 id="features3">Initial Prototype and Development</h5>
              <p>
                We created the initial prototype at <a href="http://makemit.org">MakeMIT 2017</a>,
                a hardware hackathon sponsored by MIT. When going about the design of
                system, we wanted to figure out a way to simplify the tracking aspects
                to make it as performant as possible. This way we would be able to
                port over the system to simplier and lighter platforms such as
                Raspberry Pi's to keep over costs low.
              </p>
              <p>
                We did some initial experimenting with IR tracking systems but
                found that using active trackers with IR LEDs would add too much
                complexity. So instead we decided to use a combination of
                retro-reflective material and simply look for the brightest spot
                that the camera can see.
              </p>
              <p class="center-text">
                <img class="feature-image" src="static/main-2.jpg"/>
                Picture of our mostly finished prototype taken during MakeMIT 2017.
              </p>
              <p>
                We were able to do this for a few key reasons. For one, since we
                were trying to cast a spotlight on the tracker in question we knew
                that it would, <strong>in theory</strong>, be well lit and bright.
                Second, if we were able to put the camera right at the light source
                and that these would always be moving in sync. Due to the retro-reflective material reflecting the majority of
                the light that is cast on it back to its source, we could simply look
                for the brightest spot on the screen and track it.
              </p>

                Picture of our assembled prototype from MakeMIT 2017.
              </p>
              <p>
                In terms of components, we used a Nvidia Jetson TX1 for
                the principle computer vision. This communicated with an Arduino
                through serial which controled the servos attached to the light
                and camera. For a camera, we used a standard off-the-shelve
                webcam. The Nvidia Jetson in the end was a bit overkill for our
                demo.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the software demo side, we used OpenCV for general computer
                vision and tracking, CSerial for serial communication. We spent
                a large portion of our time wrestling with C++ and the different
                libraries in question to make sure everything would work together.
                The software itself makes a few assumptions that dramatically cut
                down on computation costs. The first of these was that we were
                only concerned with the brightness of the images that we were
                receiving. Second, we were only concerned with the brightest sections
                of the image. This allowed us to filter out the bottom 90% bightest
                parts of the image, dramatically reducing noise. The results of this
                were on the platform that we were using, the Jetson TX1, we were
                fully utilizing the 30fps that we were receiving from the webcam.
                Moreover, our demo streamed multiple version of the images that
                we were processing in realtime. In a production version of LUX,
                this would be removed to further improve performance. Additionally
                we added a weight or stickiness factor to the tracked objects.
                This allowed us to reduce jitter as well as easily support multiple
                trackers.
              </p>
              <p class="center-text">

                Picture of our assembled prototype from MakeMIT 2017.
              </p>
              <p>
                Multiple tracker support from a user experience amounts to simply
                moving the desired tracker close to the light first and then pulling
                away. This would cause the tracker to blow up and be the brightest
                tracking point, making the system <strong>lock on</strong> to the tracker and continue
                to follow in the presence of other trackers in view. When you want
                to switch which tracker is being tracked, you can simply move the
                tracker close to the camera again to <strong>steal</strong> the light's focus.
              </p>

              <h5 id="features4">Future Plans</h5>
              <p>
                The next logical steps for the project are to both scale up and down.
                We plan on making multiple of the tracking units, and then attaching them
                to the single base station. Based on rough performance estimates,
                we believe that we would be able to power 6 of the tracking units
                with a single Nvidia Jetson TX1 with minimal changes to our software stack.
                In terms of scaling down, we also want to port this system over to
                a Raspberry Pi and further optimize to see how small of platform
                we would be able to use to power a single light.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once we have found the smallest computation platform we would be
                able to use, we would want to try to make a portable light that
                would also function as tracking light. This ideally would be small
                enough for mechanics to use while working under a car.

                  implemented the weighted tracking functions as well as fine-tuned
                  the various software parameters for polishing the demo.

                On the software sides of the project with David.
                I was specifically in charge of system setup and integration of the different
                systems we used. This really just amounted to wrestling with everything to make
                sure all of the required configurations were set and everything could be built.
                Lots of pair programming with David.

                Electrical engineer with experience in embedded design and IC design.
                A Senior at MIT majoring in electrical engineering.
                <br /><br />
                For LUX, he did the electronics design and assembly, along with the needed
                microcontroller programing to interface with the servos and the computer.
                He also worked on both the microcontroller and computer side debugging the interface
                to ensure reliability. Finally he set up some capacitive touch buttons for
                controlling the light's brightness.

                For LUX, she made the CAD models that we used to laser cut
                and 3D print for fittings. Worked closely with Thomas to build the
                physical/mechanical side of the demo as well as the individual trackers.

                <h4>Thomas Needham <a href="http://tneedham.github.io/Portfolio"><i class="material-icons" role="presentation">launch</i></a></h4>
                Hands-on mechatronics Senior at MIT interested in working on the
                behind-the-scenes portions of new tech. Structures, controls,
                robotics, automation, and solving problems such that the user
                doesn't even notice.
                <br><br>
                In building Lux, Thomas worked on the mechanical architecture
                for the gantry and plastic frame. Each had a design to be built
                that day, and a concept of how it could be produced en mass to
                better work for the user. Throughout the day he pieced together
                components, manufactured and assembled subsystems, and troubleshot
                continuously. Additionally, he helped to define features of the device,
                specify and source parts, and communicate the capabilities of Lux.
